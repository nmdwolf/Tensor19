## For the people using Python

To get the code to work you will need to install two packages (but we expect everybody who uses Python already has these):
* NumPy
* SciPy

## For the people using Julia:

To get the code to work you will need to add one package (this one is used for Krylov space-based iterative solvers):
* KrylovKit
